## Laravel Bus Ticketing System

**Date:** June 7, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All Issues Resolved

---

## üîç ISSUES ADDRESSED

### 1. Seat Selection Not Working
**Problem:** Seats appeared green (available) but could not be clicked/selected
**Root Cause:** Missing `@stack('scripts')` directive in layout file
**Solution:** Added `@stack('scripts')` before `</body>` tag in `layouts/app.blade.php`

### 2. Date Display Issue in Trip Details
**Problem:** Date showed schedule departure time instead of actual travel date
**Root Cause:** Using `$schedule->departure_time` instead of `$travelDate`
**Solution:** Updated Trip Details to display `$travelDate` parameter

### 3. Missing Seat Count Field and Validation
**Problem:** No seat count parameter passing from route search to seat selection
**Root Cause:** URL links not including seat_count and travel_date parameters
**Solution:** Updated all booking links to include query parameters

### 4. Multiple Seat Selection Support
**Problem:** System only supported single seat booking
**Root Cause:** No multiple seat booking functionality
**Solution:** Implemented complete multiple seat booking system

# Payment Creation Error Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary
When submitting a payment through the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment/create/12`, the system was encountering a database error:

```
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'payment_code' doesn't have a default value
```

This error occurred because the Payment model creation was missing required fields and using incorrect field names that didn't match the database schema.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing Required Field
The database migration defines `payment_code` as a required field with no default value:
```sql
$table->string('payment_code')->unique();
```

However, the PaymentController and PaymentMutation were not providing this field when creating Payment records.

### 2. Field Name Mismatches
Several field names in the code didn't match the actual database schema:

| Code Used | Database Schema | Status |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| `payment_method_id` | `payment_method` (string) | ❌ Mismatch |
| `payment_proof` | `proof_image` | ❌ Mismatch |
| `notes` | `admin_notes` | ❌ Mismatch |

### 3. Missing Relationship
The Payment model was missing the `paymentMethod` relationship that was being used throughout the application.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed PaymentController (`app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added `payment_code` generation using `'PAY-' . strtoupper(Str::random(8))`
- Changed `payment_method_id` to store payment method code in `payment_method` field
- Changed `payment_proof` to `proof_image` for database storage
- Changed `notes` to `admin_notes` for verification notes
- Added `Str` import for code generation

**Before:**
```php
$payment = Payment::create([
    'user_id' => Auth::id(),
    'booking_id' => $booking->id,
    'payment_method_id' => $request->payment_method_id,
    'amount' => $booking->total_amount,
    'status' => 'pending',
    'payment_proof' => $paymentProofPath,
]);
```

**After:**
```php
$paymentMethod = PaymentMethod::findOrFail($request->payment_method_id);

$payment = Payment::create([
    'payment_code' => 'PAY-' . strtoupper(Str::random(8)),
    'user_id' => Auth::id(),
    'booking_id' => $booking->id,
    'payment_method' => $paymentMethod->code,
    'amount' => $booking->total_amount,
    'status' => 'pending',
    'proof_image' => $paymentProofPath,
]);
```

### 2. Fixed PaymentMutation (`app/GraphQL/Mutations/PaymentMutation.php`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added `payment_code` generation
- Fixed field names to match database schema
- Updated both `create` and `verify` methods

**Updated create method:**
```php
$payment = Payment::create([
    'payment_code' => 'PAY-' . strtoupper(\Illuminate\Support\Str::random(8)),
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'booking_id' => $booking->id,
    'payment_method' => $paymentMethod->code,
    'amount' => $booking->total_amount,
    'status' => 'pending',
    'proof_image' => $paymentProofPath,
]);
```

### 3. Enhanced Payment Model (`app/Models/Payment.php`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added `paymentMethod` relationship that maps `payment_method` field to `PaymentMethod.code`

**Added relationship:**
```php
public function paymentMethod()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(PaymentMethod::class, 'payment_method', 'code');
}
```

### 4. Updated Views

**Files Updated:**
- `resources/views/payment/status.blade.php`
- `resources/views/payment/my-payments.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/payments/pending.blade.php`

**Changes Made:**
- Changed `$payment->payment_proof` to `$payment->proof_image`
- Changed `$payment->notes` to `$payment->admin_notes`
- Updated all references to use correct database field names

## Database Schema Alignment

### Current Database Schema (from migration):
```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    payment_code VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    booking_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_method VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('pending', 'verified', 'rejected') DEFAULT 'pending',
    proof_image VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    admin_notes TEXT NULL,
    payment_date TIMESTAMP NULL,
    verified_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    verified_by BIGINT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Model Fillable Fields (aligned):
```php
protected $fillable = [
    'payment_code',
    'booking_id', 
    'user_id',
    'amount',
    'payment_method',
    'status',
    'proof_image',
    'admin_notes',
    'payment_date',
    'verified_at',
    'verified_by',
];
```

## Testing Results

The payment creation process now works correctly with:

1. ✅ **Payment Code Generation**: Automatic generation of unique payment codes
2. ✅ **Field Mapping**: Correct mapping between form inputs and database fields
3. ✅ **Relationships**: Working PaymentMethod relationship for data display
4. ✅ **Data Storage**: Proper storage of payment proof images and admin notes
5. ✅ **Error Resolution**: No more "payment_code doesn't have a default value" errors

## How to Test

1. Navigate to any booking's payment creation page: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/payment/create/{booking_id}`
2. Select a payment method
3. Upload a payment proof image (optional)
4. Submit the payment
5. Verify that the payment is created successfully and redirected to payment status page

## File Changes Summary

| File | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `PaymentController.php` | Fixed | Added payment_code, fixed field names |
| `PaymentMutation.php` | Fixed | Added payment_code, fixed field names |
| `Payment.php` | Enhanced | Added paymentMethod relationship |
| `payment/status.blade.php` | Updated | Fixed field references |
| `payment/my-payments.blade.php` | Updated | Fixed field references |
| `admin/payments/pending.blade.php` | Updated | Fixed field references |

The payment system is now fully functional and aligned with the database schema.

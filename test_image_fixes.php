echo "\n=== What was Fixed ===\n";
echo "1. **Syntax Error in my-payments.blade.php:**\n";
echo "   - Fixed missing newlines between @endif and @if statements\n";
echo "   - This was causing 'unexpected token endif' parse error\n\n";

echo "2. **Payment Proof Image Display:**\n";
echo "   - Added intelligent image path detection\n";
echo "   - Supports multiple storage methods (Storage::url, asset, direct URLs)\n";
echo "   - Graceful fallback with error message when image not found\n";
echo "   - Fixed both main view and modal popup\n\n";

echo "3. **Image Path Handling:**\n";
echo "   - Checks for URLs (http/https)\n";
echo "   - Checks for base64 data URLs (data:image)\n";
echo "   - Checks storage/app/public directory\n";
echo "   - Checks public directory\n";
echo "   - Shows helpful error message if image not found\n\n";

echo "🎯 Both issues should now be resolved!\n";
echo "You can test by visiting the URLs in your browser.\n";

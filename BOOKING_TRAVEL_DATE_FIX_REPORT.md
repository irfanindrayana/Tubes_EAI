# BOOKING TRAVEL_DATE ERROR FIX - COMPLETION REPORT

## 🎯 ISSUE RESOLVED
**Error:** `SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'travel_date' doesn't have a default value`

**Root Cause:** The booking creation process was missing the required `travel_date` field when inserting records into the database.

## ✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Updated Seat Selection URLs** (`resources/views/ticketing/seats.blade.php`)
- Added `travel_date` parameter to booking URLs
- Both single and multiple seat booking URLs now include: `?travel_date={{ $travelDate }}`

### 2. **Enhanced Booking Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/TicketingController.php`)
- **Updated `booking()` method:** Now accepts and passes `travel_date` to views
- **Updated `processBooking()` validation:** Added `travel_date` as required field
- **Fixed `processBooking()` creation:** Now includes `travel_date` in booking data
- **Updated `processMultipleBooking()` validation:** Added `travel_date` as required field  
- **Fixed `processMultipleBooking()` creation:** Uses `$request->travel_date` instead of hardcoded date
- **Corrected database structure alignment:** Updated booking creation to match actual database schema

### 3. **Updated Booking Forms**
- **Single booking form** (`resources/views/ticketing/booking.blade.php`): Added `travel_date` hidden field
- **Multiple booking form** (`resources/views/ticketing/booking-multiple.blade.php`): Added `travel_date` hidden field

### 4. **Database Structure Alignment**
The booking creation was updated to match the actual database schema:
```php
// OLD (Incorrect)
'seat_id' => $seat->id,
'passenger_name' => $request->passenger_name,
'passenger_phone' => $request->passenger_phone,
'total_price' => $schedule->price,

// NEW (Correct)
'seat_count' => 1,
'seat_numbers' => [$seat->seat_number],
'passenger_details' => [[...]], 
'total_amount' => $schedule->price,
'travel_date' => $request->travel_date,
```
